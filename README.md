The goal of this project is to integrate and clean a 'dirty' dataset: integrating the SF bike trip information with restaurant inspection data. The project involves loading data, cleaning data (using string similarity and blocking), uploading data to a postgres database, and joining tables for queries.

Run `python3 insdriver.py` to run all phases of the data loading, cleaning and integration.
